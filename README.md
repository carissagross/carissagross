## A little more about me:
- Before switching to software development, for the past 5 years I worked in the climbing gym industry as a Team Manager/Coach/Mentor for a Youth Climbing Team.  Specializing in mentorship, cultivating leadership, and building community, I thrived working with others to help them learn and grow as athletes and people.  And as a freelance photographer for the past 15 years, I am inspired by light, texture, composition and capturing the beauty in the world around me.
